What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates an empty repository that I can then add commits to, saving versions
of my files. You can’t commit a file without first initializing a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different form the working directory because it is in the git
repository. It is different from the repository because it has not been committed 
yet. It is useful because you can add things as you finish them, but aren’t ready
to commit them yet.
